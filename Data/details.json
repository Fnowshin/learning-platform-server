      "_details": "At the core of this model are the four Ps: Product: Marketers should be familiar with all the features and specifications of the products they sell. Price: To determine how much your product should cost, you’ll need to do some research. Learn how your competitors price their offerings, and understand how much consumers are willing to pay. Promotion: These days, marketers have many channels through which to promote their products. From radio ads to social media banners, you’ll need to decide which are right for your brand. Place: Your customers need to be able to find and purchase your product. Can they buy your product online? Do they need to visit a store? Additionally, you’ll need to consider how much inventory to hold and where to keep it. These days, inbound marketing strategies rely on engaging content to bring customers to you (or your website). There are three more Ps; People: Optimal customer service is going to get you return customers and referrals, both of which can ultimately convert sales. Having a strong team for marketing communication is a great way to showcase your brand reputation, solve problems on the fly and connect with your customers so they continue to come back for more. Process: Creating and promoting a valuable product is essential, but the delivery process is almost just as critical for ensuring your competitive advantage. Your delivery process needs to have efficiency and reliability in mind, both from the perspective of your own team and your customers. Physical Evidence: We work from a digital ecosystem, which means that having a physical store or office outside of your home isn’t as common as it used to be. But having physical evidence of your brand is key. In this case, it could be your website, social media presence or email newsletters. Physical evidence can also include branding and packages related to your product or service. Though the fundamentals of marketing may remain steady over time, the specific strategies businesses deploy are affected by a number of factors, such as: Changing consumer demographics: Younger generations of people may respond to different appeals, compared with older generations. Customer opinions can greatly influence your content strategy. Emerging technology: Mobile devices, voice search and other developments offer new ways for marketers to reach their customers. Fluctuating market conditions: The global economy is in constant flux; what was affordable to consumers yesterday may be out of reach tomorrow. Cultural shifts: Political and social movements shape the way consumers view companies and their offerings.",

      "_details": "Before learning more about how to do successful sales and selling, it's important first to get a sense of what sales and marketing is. Sales is cultivating potential buyers (or leads) in a market; communicating the features, advantages and benefits of a product or service to the lead – then closing the sale.      Marketing involves a wide range of activities in making sure that you're continuing to meet the needs of your customers and getting value in return. Once qualified and employed within this industry you will find that it takes some beating in terms of challenge, rewards and earning potential. Every business needs sales and good sales people are constantly in demand. Typical work activities depend on the market, setting and whether the type of sales is business to business (B2B) or business to customer or consumer (B2C). However, working in a sales department is usually target driven, challenging and very active. Field work can involve travel opportunities, whilst working in contact/call centre could involve regular office hours or split shifts. Selling is now more and more about relationship management leading to repeated sales - rather than just clinching a one off deal.",
